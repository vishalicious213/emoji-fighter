# EMOJI FIGHTER

This was a Scrimba project that I added onto with customizations. The original project called for us to use the Math.random() and Math.floor() functions to generate an integer and render two emoji characters from an array in a Street Fighter II matchup versus splash screen. 

I completed that, and then after experimenting with Midjourney.ai, I added the ability for random backgrounds to be generated with new fighters.

## JavaScript concepts used:
- arrays
- functions
- document.getElementById()
- addEventListener()
- Math.floor()
- Math.random()
- template literals / template strings
- element.textContent
- element.style
    - .backgroundImage
    - .backgroundRepeat
    - .backgroundSize
    - .backgroundPosition
    - .backgroundAttachment
